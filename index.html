            <strong><em>English major, class of 2026</em></strong>
            <p>I'm originally from Berkeley (/Oakland), although I was born in Italy! Here at Cal I'm studying English, hopefully with minors in public policy and journalism, with the ideal goal of being a journalist or really any type of writer. In my free time I love to swim, hike, read, and take photographs (especially film) :)</p>
